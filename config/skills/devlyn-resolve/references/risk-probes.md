# Risk probes (PHASE 1.5)

Findings-as-executable-checks, not a second plan and not debate. The SKILL PHASE 1.5 stub owns the run condition, the unavailable-engine halt and the completion binding.

Engine: OTHER engine from the legacy executor and legacy pair priority/complement; worker/VERIFY profiles do not reroute probes. Prompt body:
`references/phases/probe-derive.md`.

Inputs: the rendered prompt (contract bytes and declared requirements), `.devlyn/plan.md`, and repo read/search. Forbidden:
`spec.expected.json`, `.devlyn/spec-verify.json`, `BENCH_FIXTURE_DIR`, hidden
fixture/verifier paths, previous findings, and harness docs.

After PLAN completes and before PROBE_DERIVE opens, render the prompt and pass
its bytes unchanged; the owner adds no text:

```bash
python3 "$DEVLYN_SHARED_DIR/phase-prompt-render.py" --devlyn-dir .devlyn --phase probe_derive --engine <OTHER engine> --round <round>
```

Output: `.devlyn/risk-probes.jsonl`, 1 to 3 JSONL entries. Each entry must be
one verification command shape plus `id`, `derived_from`, `tags`, and
`tag_evidence`, where `derived_from` is an exact substring of the visible
`## Verification` bullet the command directly exercises. `tag_evidence` must be
a JSON object keyed by tag, with marker arrays as values; a top-level array or
tag-only probe is malformed. `ordering_inversion` must include
`input_order_would_choose_wrong_winner` and `asserts_processing_order_result`;
`prior_consumption` must include `same_resource_consumed_first` and
`later_entity_fails_or_reroutes`; `stdout_stderr_contract` must include
`asserts_named_stream_output`; `error_contract` must include
`asserts_error_payload_or_stderr` and `asserts_nonzero_or_exit_2`.
`http_error_contract` must include `asserts_http_error_status` and
`asserts_error_payload_body`.
`auth_signature_contract` must include `asserts_signature_over_exact_bytes` and
`asserts_tampered_or_missing_signature_rejected`; `idempotency_replay` must
include `first_delivery_then_duplicate` and
`duplicate_id_rejected_regardless_of_body`; `concurrent_state_consistency` must
include `overlapping_mutations_exercised`,
`all_successful_responses_reflected`, and `distinct_identifiers_asserted`;
`atomic_batch_state` must include `mixed_valid_invalid_batch`,
`asserts_store_unchanged_after_failure`, and
`asserts_success_order_and_distinct_ids`.
`release_recovery`, `physical_alias`, `fixture_cleanup` and
`temp_file_preservation` must include every marker the probe-derive body lists
for them.
When visible text names exact keys, fields, row shapes, JSON objects, response
bodies, stdout/stderr objects, or exact error bodies, `shape_contract` must
include `uses_visible_input_key_names`, `asserts_visible_output_key_names`, and
`asserts_no_unexpected_output_keys`; exact JSON error objects/bodies must also
include `visible_text_names_exact_json_error_object` and
`asserts_exact_error_object`. Cart/pricing success probes should use
`shape_contract` unless they satisfy the `ordering_inversion` markers. The probe
command must not reference external network URLs; use only worktree-local or
localhost resources.
For high-complexity specs with multiple behavior bullets, at least one probe
must be compound: it must exercise two or more visible verification bullets in a
single command. Empty output is invalid when `--risk-probes` is set.

State write: `phases.probe_derive.{started_at, verdict, completed_at, duration_ms, artifacts}`.

Invocation contract when OTHER engine is Codex:

- Invoke Codex only through the monitored wrapper path in `CODEX_MONITORED_PATH`
  resolved from `DEVLYN_SHARED_DIR`:
  `DEVLYN_CODEX_PROMPT_FILE=".devlyn/probe-derive.prompt.<round>" CODEX_MONITORED_ISOLATED=1 bash "$CODEX_MONITORED_PATH" -C "$PWD" -s workspace-write -c sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=false -c model_reasoning_effort=high -`.
  Append `-c sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true` only when a probe's visible Verification command requires a localhost service (for example, a DB test harness); never as a default.
  Isolation keeps user config, AGENTS.md, hooks, and project rules
  from adding hidden context, tool calls, or transcript side effects.
- Do not run `codex`, `codex exec`, `/Users/.../codex`, or a plugin-provided
  Codex binary directly. A raw Codex child can outlive the phase and makes the
  run invalid even if `.devlyn/risk-probes.jsonl` is written.
- Capture wrapper stdout/stderr to `.devlyn/probe-derive.stdout` and
  `.devlyn/probe-derive.stderr`; branch on the wrapper exit code before
  validating `.devlyn/risk-probes.jsonl`.
