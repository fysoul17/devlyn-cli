# iter-0072 — changed-surface closure (quality axis): PRE-REGISTRATION (frozen 2026-07-14, three-way converged R0+R1)

Status: PRE-REGISTERED, NOT STARTED. No lever ships outside this
registration (user directive 2026-07-14). Archives (ephemeral):
/tmp/quality-round/{packet,r1-packet}.md + {codex,grok}-r{0,1}.log.

## Problem (measured)

nodeg-20260713: objective 7/7 PASS, blind quality 0/7 (codex judge 28/28
axes prefer frozen bare B), wall 0/7. Quality-omission class on saturated
rows: A ships the literal floor; B additionally closes the CHANGED
SURFACE — help/usage of the changed command (same authorized file),
error-path tests of the changed behavior, error text carrying the observed
value (F7), plus design-level closure (F25 catalog parse handling, all
matching promotions).

## Root cause (three-way converged, receipts)

Causal chain: free-form synthesis "when in doubt, narrower"
(free-form-mode.md:62) → criteria.generated.md narrows explicit goal
clauses (F25 "file-read failures" → --input only; F7 --help declared out
of scope) → PLAN EXCLUDES the closure work verbatim ("Refuse: touching
USAGE"; error-path regression test labeled "unrequested addition" — F7
plan.md:15,22; F25 plan.md:14,22 in the archived A-arm workspaces) →
IMPLEMENT obeys (implement.md:6,:35) → VERIFY grades against generated
criteria (verify.md:9), structurally cannot re-open. Always-loaded
anti-drift prose (CLAUDE.md:80,109,110,122; runtime-principles.md:25,54,55,
66-67; E1 = measured suppressor iter-0062) is the background field the
narrowing agent runs under — plausible co-cause, held for isolation.

## Decisive criterion (both engines, near-identical)

**Changed-Surface Coherence Is Requested; Cross-Surface Expansion Is
Drift** (Grok) ≡ **Frozen-Boundary Changed-Surface Closure** (Codex): an
addition is in scope only when it (a) preserves an explicit goal clause,
(b) updates an existing user-visible reference made stale by the named
change, or (c) regression-tests a specified success/failure path — all
inside the frozen file/behavior boundary. Other behaviors/files, drive-by
cleanup, speculative handlers for cases the change does not create remain
drift.

## Stage 1 (the only shipping lever until its falsifier resolves)

free-form-mode.md:62 (+ .claude/.agents mirrors), one-clause substitution:
- OLD: "every assumption scope-narrowing and reversible — when in doubt,
  narrower"
- NEW (candidate wording, final at build time): "every assumption
  reversible; narrow only unspecified behavior outside the named change —
  never an explicit clause, its existing user-visible references, or
  focused tests of specified success/failure paths"

Token caps: root/shared delta = 0; resolve load-set ≤ +0.1% (both gauge
approximations).

## Stage 2 (HELD; unlocks only per ladder branch 2)

L1 E1-sentence carve + L2 CLAUDE.md:122 completeness-bullet narrowing +
L3 edge-cases-created-by-this-change exception (CLAUDE.md:80 region) +
L4 implement.md:17 quality_bar expansion. Caps: always-loaded ≤ +6 lines
net across the three mirrors; L4 resolve-load ≤ +0.1%. Attribution caveat
(Codex R1): Stage-2 recovery attributes to the downstream composite, not
to any single sentence.

## Falsifier ladder (5 branches, frozen)

1. Stage-1 ARTIFACT predictions fail (regenerated F7 criteria/PLAN still
   exclude banner update + unsupported-format regression test, or F25
   criteria drop catalog failure clauses) → lever wording falsified; STOP;
   fresh pre-registration required; does NOT unlock Stage 2.
2. Artifacts open + objective 7/7 + quality floor FAILS (< 2/7 or F7/F25
   not both passing "no B_win on any axis from either judge") → Stage 2
   unlocks.
3. Stage 2 reruns identical gates (objective, quality, drift, compliance,
   stable-clean, token).
4. Artifacts open + quality ≥ floor → STOP, Stage 2 stays unshipped
   (subtractive-first).
5. Stage 2 also fails → next pre-registered locus: PLAN "simplest tactic"
   (implement.md:6), then VERIFY advisory-quality threshold. Never "more
   completeness prose".

## Merged gates (ship = ALL pass)

- Artifact predictions (branch-1 early kill, before any full re-measure).
- nodeg re-run, same 7 rows, same frozen B hashes (nodeg-verdict.json
  frozen_b_sources), same seats (sonnet orchestrator/judge + terra
  executor/judge), --pair-verify parity: objective stays 7/7; quality
  0/7 → ≥2/7 with F7+F25 mandatory; any timeout/objective loss = no-ship.
- Advisory (not gating): codex B_win 28/28 → ≤22/28 (style-match risk noted).
- Drift non-regression: violation-matrix N=4 within established flip
  bands; stable-clean B2/B5/DB-failing-adjacent-test stay 0/4; six-probe
  resolve-framed drift-bait hidden verifiers all pass.
- Compliance cells: 3 CLI × 2 size all pass (state, ordered phases, VERIFY
  evidence, archive, finish-gate).
- Token caps per stage (above).
- Wall axis explicitly OUT of this iter's success claim (iter-0071's
  mechanism).

## Sequencing note

Runs AFTER the iter-0071 nodeg re-measure (P1/P2'/P3' baseline capture) so
the two levers' effects don't confound: 0071 re-measure first (no 0072
edits in tree), then Stage 1 lands, then the 0072 nodeg run doubles as the
quality gate.

## Amendment 1 — Stage-1 lever RELOCATED branch-neutrally (2026-07-16, three-way converged; Fable + Codex sol + Grok 4.5, 3/3 on option B)

**Trigger (new evidence, orchestrator-verified then independently re-read by
both seats).** The nx01 A-arm workspaces survive post-run (contra the 0071.4
retention-gap wording — `.devlyn/runs/<id>/{criteria.generated.md,plan.md,
pipeline.state.json}` are intact for both nodeg cohorts). Reading them:

| Row | nodeg-20260713 (pre-L-A) | nodeg-20260714 (post-L-A baseline) |
|---|---|---|
| F7 | `complexity=large`; criteria:26 `## Assumptions`; plan:15 "Refuse: touching USAGE"; plan:22 error-path test = "unrequested addition" (= the registration receipts) | `complexity=medium`; NO Assumptions block; same omission via criteria Constraints ("No other subcommand (`hello`, `--help`) may change behavior") + plan Risks ("Byte-for-byte … including the `USAGE` string"; only json-path test planned) |
| F25 | `complexity=large`; criteria:25 narrows explicit "file-read failures" clause to "on the `--input` path" **inside `## Requirements`** | `complexity=medium`; criteria R5 carries the clause VERBATIM; plan adds the USAGE entry; quality loss = 3602s timeout (invoke_exit 124), not criteria narrowing |

iter-0071 L-A (goal_length>80 Large-trigger deletion) moved both receipt rows
Large→Medium, so the registered host — the line-62 Large-branch Assumptions
parenthetical — is no longer traversed by any receipt row. Running branch-1
against it would test unmeasured context-seepage and make placement-miss
indistinguishable from wording failure.

**Named deltas.** Codex sol: "Post-L-A Branch-Host Reachability" (R0 accepted
the registered path; pipeline.state.json complexity fields disprove it).
Grok: R0 held line 62 as the only open surface; the fresh artifacts are
placement evidence, not wording taste. Decisive criterion (all seats):
**Causal-Path Placement** — a wording lever ships only into text the receipt
rows demonstrably traverse.

**Relocated lever (replaces §Stage 1's line-62 substitution; line 62 stays
UNCHANGED — no dual-host token spend).** Replace the "Mini-spec quality bar"
intro line (free-form-mode.md:75 + `.claude`/`.agents` mirrors):

- OLD (91c/13w): `The internal mini-spec written for trivial / medium /
  large-assumptions paths must satisfy:`
- NEW (194c/25w): `Never narrow an explicit goal clause, nor exclude
  user-visible references the change stales or tests of specified
  success/failure paths. Every mini-spec (trivial/medium/large) must also
  satisfy:`
- Delta +103c/+12w — under the frozen caps (≤+120c/≤+15w = +0.1% resolve
  load-set both gauges); root/shared delta 0.

Fable synthesis delta vs both seats' R1 texts (named): their
"Constraints/Out-of-Scope never absorb …" scoping misses the third observed
channel — F25-20260713's intra-clause narrowing sat inside `## Requirements`
(criteria:25 under heading :5). "Never narrow an explicit goal clause"
is section-unscoped by design; carriers (b)/(c) are exclusion-verbs
("nor exclude …"), matching how F7's omissions actually manifest.

**Gate protocol updates (predictions otherwise unchanged).**
- Record which branch fired per row (`pipeline.state.json` `complexity`).
- F7 stays THE discriminating row: regenerated criteria/PLAN must include the
  USAGE update and the unsupported-format error-path test.
- F25 re-anchored to non-regression (its post-L-A baseline already carries
  the clause + USAGE entry).
- Artifact inspection happens as each row completes inside the full nodeg
  run (rows execute in CONTROL_ORDER F7→F25→…), before judge wall is spent;
  branch-1 fire → kill the run, STOP per ladder (fresh pre-registration;
  Stage 2 stays locked).

**Authority.** Both seats: formal amendment + DECISIONS entry recorded before
the edit lands satisfies "no lever ships outside this registration"
(2026-07-14); relocation is reported to the user before the nodeg quality
run. Seat dissent would have escalated to the user; there was none (3/3 B).

## Branch-1 FIRED — Stage-1 wording FALSIFIED, valid-negative (2026-07-16, same session)

Run `nodeg-20260716` (runner `03c3e4b`, CLI pin 2.1.211, amendment loaded in the
workspace skill copy — verified by grep before judging the artifacts). F7
regenerated under the relocated lever, `complexity: medium` as predicted:

- criteria.generated.md again lists `--help` under `## Out of Scope` and demands
  only the json-path test — the new quality-bar sentence sat in the same file
  and was not obeyed at synthesis time.
- plan.md REFUSES both carriers explicitly: "do not update `USAGE` to mention
  `--format` — that's unrequested scope expansion … even though it would look
  'more complete'"; "do not add an exit-1/`--format yaml` test … since that
  isn't requested". Archived: `benchmark/ceiling/results/nodeg-20260716/
  branch1-early-kill/` (criteria + plan + pipeline.state + VERDICT.md).

Ladder branch 1 executed as frozen: run killed before judge wall (no row
completed; run-id dead), lever REVERTED in all three mirrors (falsified prose
does not stay shipped — iter-0066 L5 precedent), Stage 2 stays LOCKED, fresh
pre-registration required.

**Diagnostic carried into the fresh registration**: the refusals quote the
always-loaded anti-drift vocabulary verbatim ("unrequested scope expansion",
"subtractive-first / no-overengineering", "isn't requested"). A same-file
reference rule loses to the always-loaded field. This is evidence FOR the
registration's original isolation hypothesis (root cause §: "always-loaded
anti-drift prose … plausible co-cause, held for isolation") — but branch 1
does NOT unlock Stage 2; the next lever must be re-registered three-way from
these receipts.
